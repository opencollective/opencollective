## What is OpenCollective?

Open Collective is an online funding platform for open and transparent communities. We provide the tools to raise money and share your finances in full transparency.

## Documentation

Please see our help docs for all info, including user guide, how to contribute, and developer docs: https://docs.opencollective.com

## Bounties

Get paid to contribute to Open Source! The Open Collective engineering team is small and we're always looking for new contributors to our Open Source codebases. Our Bounty program is an opportunity to solve issues that could be neglected otherwise. Contributors who fix these issues will be rewarded financially. Please see our docs for more information: https://docs.opencollective.com/help/contributing/development/bounties
