SECURITY.md# Security Policy

We believe that no technology is perfect and that working with skilled security researchers
is crucial in identifying weaknesses.

If you believe you've found a security bug in our service, we'll be happy to work with you
to resolve the issue promptly and ensure you are fairly rewarded for your discovery.

We will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly resolve any vulnerability.
To encourage responsible reporting, we will not take legal action against you nor ask law enforcement
to investigate you providing you comply with the current policy and more generally with the following guideline: Make a good faith effort to
avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.

## Eligibility and Responsible Disclosure

Only those that meet the following eligibility requirements may receive a monetary reward:

- You must be the first reporter of a vulnerability.
- The vulnerability must be a qualifying vulnerability.
- Any vulnerability found must be reported no later than 72 hours after discovery.
- You must send a clear textual description of the report along with steps to reproduce the issue, include attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code as necessary.
- You must avoid tests that could cause degradation or interruption of our service (refrain from using automated tools, and limit yourself about requests per second).
- You must not leak, manipulate, or destroy any user data.
- You must not be a former or current employee of Open Collective or one of its contractor.
- You must wait for the issue to be fully fixed before exposing it publicly.
- There must be proof that, given realistic processing power and time, an exploit is possible.

## Scope

We **won't** accept reports made by testing on our production servers (https://opencollective.com).

You must ideally do all the testing locally. See the following links:

## Process

- Reporter submit a report. To make sure that you don't loose too much time preparing a nice report if the issue is already known from us, you can submit just a small summary without technical details and proofs of concepts.
- Open Collective Team...
  - Confirms that the report has been received. If it's an unknown issue, we may ask you for more details.
  - Tries to confirm/reproduce the issue.
  - Discuss results and possible impact to determine the score (low/medium/high/critical) and bounty amount.
- Reporter is rewarded with a bounty at this stage (if applicable).
- Team works on a fix, verifies it an pushes it.
- Team confirms that the issue has been patched and may ask reporter to check the fix.
- We write a postmortem to document the issue. From this point it is safe for reporter to go public about the issue.

## How do we calculate the severity score

Our analysis is always based on worst case exploitation of the vulnerability, as is the reward we pay. We will rely on CVSS3 as well as internal criteria to score the vulnerabilities.

Things that we take into account to adjust the score for vulnerabilities:

- Everything related to authentication
- Allow to take control or leak information about payment methods or connected accounts
- Compromise the integrity or historicity of our transactions ledger
- Compromise the permission system
