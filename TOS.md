TL;DR

OpenCollective is a platform to collect money and disperse it in all transparency. Users can create a collective, act as backers or sponsors and become hosts of collectives. Hosting a collective means that the money collected by the collectives will be stored in their bank account on their behalf. In this case, in order to retrieve those donations and receive the reimbursement of the expenses occurred within the collective, core contributors of the collectives must submit such expenses with the picture or PDF of the receipt via the OpenCollective app (https://app.opencollective.com).

OpenCollective is not responsible for the activities carried out by the Collectives that use it's platform, nor does due diligence on the validity and veracity of their claims.

####BACKING A COLLECTIVE
**How a Collective can use OpenCollective**<br>
Each registered User can create a Collective on OpenCollective and use the platform as a tool to keep track of how the money is disbursed by the Collective.
Some Collectives may also use OpenCollective as a tool to showcase and advertise a project that needs funding and, in so doing, the Collective may solicit Users (Backers and Sponsors) to back the project.
In such cases, OpenCollective works as a crowdfunding platform that handles all transactions in full transparency.

**How to back a project on OpenCollective**<br>
If User wants to back a project, (s)he needs to visit the Collective page on OpenCollective, select the amount that (s)he wishes to donate and click on the button displayed at the bottom of such page.
Further information about the possible privileges linked to a donation shall be displayed on the Collective page on OpenCollective.

**Methods of payment**<br>
OpenCollective allows one-off and monthly or yearly recurring donations. 
OpenCollective uses third-party tools (i.e. PayPal or Stripe) for its donation processing and is not connected with any of the provided payment information – such as the credit card – in any way. If the Company of any of such third-party tools refuses to authorize a payment, the Company will not be held liable for any delay or failure to process the payment. Each donation is directly transferred on the PayPal or Stripe account connected to the project and the Company is never part of the transactions that take place between Backers/Sponsors and the members of the Collective/Host, nor of the agreement entered into between the members of the Collective/Host and the Backers/Sponsors.
Users must be aware that they can stop their recurring donation plan at any time by changing their PayPal or Stripe account settings or their payment plan from within OpenCollective.

**Your duties when you back a project**<br>
User is requested to carefully check the project and the conditions set forth by the Collective/Host before making any donation.
Although the Company shall make all the possible efforts to provide Users with a healthy community and reliable projects to back, User must understand that it is impossible for the Company to carry out a scrupulous due diligence on each project that is posted on OpenCollective. Therefore, User is requested to do so for any project (s)he wishes to back.
User shall also be solely responsible for checking the fiscal regulations that apply to the donations and the maximum amount that is allowed for the donation according to the local legislation that applies and to the chosen method of payment.

####Collective duties and liabilities
When the members of a Collective post a project on OpenCollective soliciting each User to back such a project, they are inviting the User to enter into an agreement with them. Under no circumstances, the Company can be considered part of this contractual relationship which takes place solely between the User (i.e. Backer/Sponsor) and the Collective.
However, each member of a Collective is requested to strictly comply with the following rules:<br>
The Collective is solely responsible for 
<ul>
<li>complying with any provision of law and/or regulation which applies to their business and project(s) including, but not limited to, fiscal or employment law;</li>
<li>conspicuously post all the expenses and transaction related to the project on OpenCollective following the instruction provided;</li>
<li>keep the highest standards of communication and transparency in carrying out the projects. Although the Software will help to carry out the project with the utmost transparency, Collective agrees to put all the reasonable efforts in establishing a healthy and active communication with Users and comply with any further disclosure request, unless such requests are potentially harmful for the project and/or inappropriate and/or may potentially translate into an unreasonable delay for the project.</li>
</ul>
The above, without any prejudice to the right of Users to bring the appropriate legal actions against the members of a Collective in case of breach of their contractual obligations.

####Host
If you are a Host you can receive funds in the name of the Collective and reimburse the Collective’s members who submitted expenses via OpenCollective.
In this case, the money raised by the Collective will be stored in the bank account of the Host. The Collective will submit expenses with the picture or PDF of the receipt via the OpenCollective app (https://app.opencollective.com). The Host shall approve those expenses and the members of the Collective will be reimbursed on the personal paypal email that they have listed in their profile page.

If you are a Host which is a US nonprofit organization corporation exempt from federal taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), you can also act as a Fiscal Sponsor for the Collective.

If you are a nonprofit Host outside of the US please note that agreements such as fiscal sponsorship and the like may not be allowed in your country. You are solely responsible for the compliance with the applicable law of your corporation and of the agreement/relationship you establish with the Collective.


**Host duties and liabilities**<br>
If you are acting as Host of a Collective, this means that you are collecting money on behalf of the Collective. Therefore,
when you post a project and endorse a Collective on OpenCollective, soliciting each User to back such a project, you are inviting the User to enter into an agreement with you or your corporation. Under no circumstances the Company can be considered part of this contractual relationship which takes place solely between the User (i.e. Backer/Sponsor) and the Host/Collective.
However, each Host is requested to strictly comply with the following rules:<ul>
<li>Host is solely responsible for complying with any provision of law and/or regulation which applies to their business and project(s) including, but not limited to, fiscal or employment law;</li>
<li>conspicuously allow the members of the Collective to post all the expenses and transaction related to the project on OpenCollective following the instruction provided;</li>
<li>carefully report in the accounting books all the transactions that have been done on behalf of the Collective;</li>
<li>keep the highest standards of communication and transparency in carrying out the projects. Although the Software will help to carry out the project with the utmost transparency, Host agrees to put all the reasonable efforts in establishing a healthy and active communication with Users and Collectives and comply with any further disclosure request, unless such requests are potentially harmful for the project and/or inappropriate and/or may potentially translate into an unreasonable delay for the project;</li>
</ul>
The above, without any prejudice to the right of Users to bring the appropriate legal actions against the Host and/or the members of a Collective in case of breach of their contractual obligations.

**International Use by Nonprofit Host**<br>
If you are a nonprofit Host organised under the laws of countries other than those of the United States of America, you represent, warrant, and irrevocably covenant that you will refrain from making financial transactions through OpenCollective if you are located in a country embargoed by the United States or are on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals. If you choose to use OpenCollective, you are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws, for setting forth an agreement with the Collective you host that complies with the applicable law.

**Refunds**<br>
Backers and Sponsors must understand that when they back a project, they’re backing an idea and, most of the time, helping to create a project from scratch. There may be changes or delays and something could theoretically happen that prevents the Collective/Host from being able to carry out the project. Responsibility for carrying out aproject lies entirely with the Collective/Host.
In order to understand if and under what conditions refunds are allowed, Users must refer to their agreement with the Collective/Host and ask directly to such third parties if they wish to have further information or if they want to ask for a refund.
OpenCollective doesn’t offer refunds. The Company doesn’t hold funds on Collective/Host’s behalf, cannot guarantee Collective/Host’s work, and does not endorse or sponsor any of the Collective/Host’s projects displayed on OpenCollective.

**Termination**<br>
Users can terminate the Agreement with the Company at any time by merely canceling their account. However, upon termination, Collectives and Hosts remain obligated to pay OpenCollective for all unpaid fees and costs.
In any case, Users acknowledge and agree that all provisions of the Agreement survive termination, including the rights of the Company over any content already posted on OpenCollective including but not limited to projects.
Under no circumstance the exercise of the right to terminate the contract shall entitle any User to ask for any compensation of any kind and for whatever reason.

**Fees of the Company**<br>
Creating a User account on OpenCollective is free. However, if User wants to create a Collective, the Company shall charge, on a monthly basis, a fee of 5% of all donations/membership fees received through OpenCollective. The credit card fees are calculated separately and charged to the User on a monthly basis as well. Such expenses may vary according to the payment method chosen by Users.

If you are an organisation with multiple chapters and act as their Host on OpenCollective the 5% fee should amount at least to 10 USD per month per each active Collective you host. “Active” refers to any income or reimbursement done through the platform. User is responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of OpenCollective. Therefore, if the monthly donations/dues received through the platform for each Collective generates a 5% fee that is below 10 USD, the Host must pay the difference in fees. User is responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of OpenCollective.
