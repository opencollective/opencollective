# Code of Conduct

### Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
  environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender
  identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion,
  nationality, or other similar characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
  might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all. Obviously different people's ideas of what constitutes sexual
  may vary as do definitions of overt but please use good judgment
  and consider that a sexual nickname communicates to everyone
  reading it, indescriminately. 
* Please be kind and courteous. Being mean and rude is seldom
  constructive.
* Respect that some individuals and cultures consider the casual use of
  profanity offensive and off-putting.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term
  "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of
  Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of
  clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
  excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if
  you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
  by a community member, please contact email below immediately with a
  capture (log, photo, email) of the harassment if possible. Whether
  you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this
  a safe place for you and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
* Try to avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer").
